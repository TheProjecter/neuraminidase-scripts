"Molecular distribution of amino acid substitutions on neuraminidase from the 2009 AH1N1 Human Influenza Pandemic virus"..The manuscript presents for first time a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the molecular distribution of amino acid substitutions (AASS) in the neuraminidase of influenza AH1N1 virus associated to the 2009 pandemic. We analyzed neuraminindase AASS from all available reported pandemic AH1N1 sequences. Comparisons of the molecular distributions of AASS were performed between sequences reported from America, Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania and specifically from Mexico. The distribution of AASS were determined at the level of the secondary structure of the protein sequence, as well as the active site and catalytic site level.

The results confirmed that the reported NA AASS have followed a universal pattern of distribution worldwide. Interestingly we confirmed an emergence of a small number of AASS affecting the previously conserved active and catalytic sites of NA.
